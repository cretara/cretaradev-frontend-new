                I'm delighted to welcome you to my portfolio, where you can
                explore more than 17 years of experience as a full-stack
                developer specializing in web and mobile applications for public
                administrations and medium to large-sized businesses. Throughout
                my career, I've worked on challenging projects that have tested
                my creativity and problem-solving abilities. This portfolio is a
                window into my passion for technology and innovation, as well as
                a showcase of the results I've achieved. I have a deep
                admiration for the technologies, frameworks, and open-source
                platforms that have powered many of my creations. The
                open-source ecosystem represents a global community of brilliant
                minds collaborating to make the digital world a better place. My
                work has been profoundly influenced by this philosophy of
                sharing and cooperation, and I continually seek to give back to
                this community through my personal contributions.
